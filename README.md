Output Data Format
==================
Output data is located in `/home/pi/rct/`.  Each run consists of a number of IQ
(raw) data files, GPS data files, and a metadata file.  The name format for each
type of file is `[type]_[run]_[file_num]`.  The `type` field specifies, in
capital letters, the type of file (i.e. RAW_DATA, GPS, or META).  The `run`
field specifies a numerical identifier for each run, assigned sequentially.
This field is always 6 characters wide, zero padded.  The `file_num` field
specifies the ordering of the IQ data files.  The first file recorded would have
a file number of 1, sequential files having sequential numbers.  This field is
always 6 characters wide, zero padded.

The raw data files contain the raw IQ data recorded as pairs of 8-bit unsigned
integers.  Each pair represents the in-phase and quadrature components of the
recorded signal in sequence.  See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-phase_and_quadrature_components for an
explanation of IQ signal representation.  Each file contains at most 10485760
samples, or 5.12 seconds of data.  IQ data is recorded at 2.048 MSps.

The GPS data files contain timestamped snapshots of autopilot telemetry.  Fields
are comma separated, and are: local capture time (UTC in seconds), lat (degrees
\* 1e7), lon (degrees * 1e7), time since autopilot boot (ms), absolute altitude
(meters MSL), relative altitude (meters AGL), x axis velocity (m/s), y axis
velocity (m/s), z axis velocity (m/s), heading (degrees).  Note: I do not know
whether the heading is relative to true north or magnetic north.  The NED frame
ideally is relative to true north, but I don't know if the heading is reported
before or after declination offsets are taken into account.

The metadata file contains metadata pertaining to the configuration of the
payload.  Each line contains one field.  The key for each field is followed by a
colon, then the value for that field, followed by a newline character:
```
[field_name]: [field_value]
```
The whitespace between the colon and field value is optional, and preferred for
readability, but cannot be a newline.  The metadata file contains the following
fields: local IQ data start time (UTC in seconds), SDR center frequency (Hz),
SDR sampling frequency (Hz), SDR gain (dB).
