\chapter{Manual Objective}
	This manual is intended for the end user of the Radio Collar Tracker system.  It is written with the expectation that the end user has some experience flying \glspl{multirotor} in semi-autonomous or autonomous modes.  This manual should not be regarded as standalone training manual for flight operations, rather, it should part of hands-on training on how to operate this system safely.  This manual contains procedures on how to safely operate this system, as well as information on how to maintain and repair the system.
\chapter{System Overview}
	\section{Mission Profile}
		This system is designed to conduct aerial surveys for the purpose of tracking and localizing wildlife collars used for biological and ecological research.  We approach this problem by flying a radio across the search area, recording the signal strength for any pings from any collars we can detect.  We can then determine the location of a collar by correlating the signal strength and the locations where we detected that particular signal strength.
	\section{Aircraft}
		\subsection{Aircraft Summary}
			The airframe used in this \gls{uas} is a Tarot Ironman 650, which is a carbon-fiber \gls{quadcopter} airframe.  We have then integrated a commercial open-source autopilot, the 3DR PixHawk, to use as our primary flight controller.  To maximize flight time, we have settled on a battery pack consisting of 3 3S 5.1 Ah batteries connected in parallel.  As a result of this configuration, we can acheive a total flight time of 20-23 minutes at a maximum speed of 5 m/s.

			\end{figure}
			\subsubsection{Flight Modes}
				This \gls{uas} has multiple flight modes that allow the \gls{pic} various amounts of control, and permit the \gls{uas} to perform a variety of tasks.  These flight modes are all to some extent controlled by the computer, and can be controlled from either the RC transmitter or the \gls{gcs}.
				\paragraph{Stabilize}
					Stabilize (shown as STABILIZE) is the most basic mode available.  In this mode, the \gls{pic} has direct control over the attidue and throttle of the aircraft. See Figure 2.2 for stick layout.
					\begin{figure}[ht]
						\centering
						\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{stabilize_stick_layout.png}
						\caption{Stabilize Stick Layout}
					\end{figure}
				\paragraph{Altitude Hold}
					Altitude Hold (shown as ALT\_HOLD) is one step above STABILIZE in computer control.  In this mode, the \gls{pic} has direct control over the attidue of the aircraft, however, the autopilot is responsible for maintaining the altitude of the aircraft.  Because the autopilot is actively controlling the aircraft, this is a GPS-controlled mode, and requires optimal GPS lock.  Altitude is held by placing the throttle stick to 50\%.  Pushing the throttle stick up moves the altitude setpoint up at a rate proportional to the stick value, and vice versa.  See Figure 2.3 for stick layout.
					\begin{figure}[ht]
						\centering
						\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{althold_stick_layout.png}
						\caption{Altitude Hold Stick Layout}
					\end{figure}
				\paragraph{Loiter}
					Loiter (shown as LOITER) is one step below complete computer control.  In this mode, the \gls{pic} can only tell the aircraft to move.  The autopilot is responsible for maintaining the altitude, attitude, and responsiveness of the aircraft.  Essentially, the aircraft is simply loitering at a point in space, and the \gls{pic} is simply telling the aircraft that it should go loiter somewhere else.  Because the autopilot is actively controlling the aircraft, this is a GPS-controlled mode, and requires optimal GPS lock.  Altitude is held by placing the throttle stick to 50\%.  Pushing the throttle stick up moves the altitude setpoint up at a rate proportional to the stick value, and vice versa.  See Figure 2.4 for stick layout.
					\begin{figure}[ht]
						\centering
						\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{loiter_stick_layout.png}
						\caption{Loiter Stick Layout}
					\end{figure}
				\paragraph{Auto}
					Auto (shown as AUTO) is the autonomous mission mode.  In this mode, the autopilot has complete control authority over the aircraft.  The \gls{pic} can only command the \gls{uas} to enter or exit this mode.  The autopilot will execute the loaded mission, controlled from the \gls{gcs}.  Because the autopilot is actively controlling the aircraft, this is a GPS-controlled mode, and requires optimal GPS lock.
				\paragraph{Return-to-Launch}
					\gls{rtl} is an emergency retrieval mode.  In this mode, the autopilot has complete control authority over the aircraft.  The \gls{pic} can only command the \gls{uas} to enter or exit this mode.  The autopilot will command the aircraft to fly directly to the launch GPS coordinates, then gently land.  Because the autopilot is actively controlling the aircraft, this is a GPS-controlled mode, and requires optimal GPS lock.  During the landing phase, the \gls{pic} can nudge the aircraft using the right stick to avoid any obstacles.  This is similar to loiter, however, the \gls{pic} cannot override the descent phase without exiting the \gls{rtl} mode.  See Figure 2.5 for stick layout.

	\section{Payload}
		\subsection{Payload Summary}
			The payload for this \gls{uas} is basically a computerized radio recorder.  We have elected to use a software defined radio as our radio frontend, as this allows us to rapidly reconfigure the payload for any range of frequencies.  This is connected to a Raspberry PI 2, which handles all of the data collection, including collecting position data from the autopilot system.  Recorded data is organized into runs, which are stored on a removeable USB drive.
		\subsection{Payload Specifications}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Computer\hfill Raspberry Pi 2
				\item Weight \hfill 125 g
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Payload Layout}
	\section{Ground Control System}
		The \gls{gcs} for this \gls{uas} consists of a laptop running a Windows OS and the open source flight management software, MissionPlanner.  This connects to the aircraft over a 3DR 900 MHz radio, permitting 2-way digital communications between the \gls{uas} and the \gls{gcs}.  From the \gls{gcs}, we are able to plan, upload, and control all missions, as well as provide the pilot with flight and diagnostic information.
		\subsection{Ground Control System Layout}
	\section{Crew Roles}
		\subsection{Pilot In Command}
			The \gls{pic} is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft.  He or she is responsible for takeoff, transition to mission, return, and landing, as well as for the general pacing of the mission.
		\subsection{Autopilot Operator}
			The \gls{AO} is responsible for monitoring the flight management software and mission progress.  He or she must plan and upload the mission plan to the aircraft, confirm clearance for switching to autonomous flight modes, and monitor the \gls{uas} as it completes the mission.
\chapter{Checklists and Flight Procedures}
	The \gls{pic} must use the below checklists and procedures when operating the system to ensure safe and proper operation of the system.  Failure to complete all items in either checklists or procedures may result in system misconfiguration or system failure.  The PIC is responsible for the operation of the aircraft in accordance with all relevant rules and procedures, except that the PIC may deviate from these rules where such deviation is necessary in the interests of safety.

\chapter{Emergency Procedures}
	\section{Battery Fire on Ground}
		Battery fires are caused by extreme physical or electrical damage to the battery pack.  Battery fires may be preceeded by significant warming and/or puffing of the battery pack.
		\begin{mdframed}[linecolor=red,linewidth=4pt]
			WARNING: \gls{LiPo} fires are chemical fires, and can release dangerous chemicals.  ABC fire extinguishers are NOT effective against the primary battery fire, but may prevent the fire from spreading.  If available, use a CO2, dry chemical, or foam extinguisher to contain the primary fire.  Do not use water to extinguish the primary fire, however, water may be used to cool a battery and fight secondary fires as appropriate.
		\end{mdframed}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If the battery has not caught fire yet, but is extremely warm, immediately unplug it from any devices and take the battery outside.  Place it away from flammable items and in a well ventilated area. Allow the battery to sit for at least 30 minutes.  If the battery has cooled down in 30 minutes, it will likely not catch fire, however, the battery must be disposed of properly.  If the battery is still hot, allow it to remain outside until it has cooled off.
			\item If the battery catches fire while connected to a charger, disconnect the charger from the wall, and, if safe to do so, carry the entire charging setup outside, away from flammable items and place in a well ventilated area. If not safe to do so, remove flammable items from the area and fight any secondary fires.  Do not fight the battery fire itself, as it is self-oxidizing.

			Even if the primary fire is out, if the pack is warm, additional cells may catch fire due to thermal loading.  The battery pack is not safe until the entire pack is cooled to room temperature.
			\item If the battery catches fire while connected to the aircraft, if safe to do so, remove the battery from the aircraft.  If unable to remove the battery, if safe to do so, flip the aircraft so that the battery is on top of the aircraft to reduce damage to the aircraft.  Carry the batteries and any attached items outside, away from flammable items and place in a well ventilated area.  If not safe to move the batteries, remove flammable items from the area and fight any secondary fires.  Do not fight the primary battery fire itself, as it is self-oxidizing.

			Even if the primary fire is out, if the pack is warm, additional cells may catch fire due to thermal loading.  The battery pack is not safe until the entire pack is cooled to room temperature.
		\end{enumerate}
	\section{Loss of Autopilot Datalink}
		If the autopilot operator reports loss of link to the \gls{uas} (characterized by no data packets received for about 5 seconds), then the \gls{pic} should immediately place the \gls{uas} into \gls{rtl} by setting the \gls{rtl} switch on the RC transmitter.  Visually verify that \gls{uas} is in \gls{rtl}.  If the \gls{uas} is not in \gls{rtl}, go to the Loss of Control procedure.
	\section{Loss of RC Link}
		If the RC transmitter reports loss of link to the \gls{uas}, the the \gls{AO} should immediately place the \gls{uas} into \gls{rtl} by mannually ordering \gls{rtl} through the \gls{gcs}.  Visually verify that the \gls{uas} is in \gls{rtl}.  If the \gls{uas} is not in \gls{rtl}, go to the Loss of Control procedure.
	\section{Loss of Control}
		Set the \gls{rtl} switch on the RC transmitter.  If the \gls{uas} was in on a mission, move the RC transmitter towards the mission area to regain connection.  If the \gls{uas} was in a loiter mode, move the RC transmitter towards the last known position to regain connection.  Because the radio failsafes are configured to automatically return the \gls{uas} in the event that the \gls{uas} notices a loss of connection, connection should be reestablished fairly quickly.
\chapter{Maintenance}
	This section contains checklists and procedures to facilitate the maintenance and repair of the \gls{uas}.  The \gls{uas} must pass all items within the Delivery Check before being placed into service.  Failure of any one of these checks may result in system failure.

	\section{Replacing Propellers}
		Carbon fiber propellers should be replaced if they show signs of cracking or damage.  This manifests as cracks or delamination of the propeller, usually near the tip, but occasionally near the root of the propeller.  To check for cracks or delamination of the propeller, feel along all surfaces of the propeller for any sharp edges or nicks - this is usually the starting point of delamination.  Additionally, flex the propellers to check for any cracking - this will manifest as cracking sounds and the feeling that the propeller is abnormally easier to flex.

		To remove the propeller, remove the two screws and plate holding the propeller to the motor.  Remove the propeller.

		To install the propeller, place the propeller on the rotor shaft, and align the propeller to the screw holes.  Install the top plate and the screws.  Tighten.
	\section{Replacing Arms}
		To remove the arms, first pop the arm to be replaced towards the midline of the copter.  Once the arm is disengaged from plastic keeper, remove the screws holding the boom to the body of the aircraft.  The screw on the top of the body is hidden underneath the autopilot.  Simply push the autopilot gently out of the way to access the screw.  Pull the arm out of the body.  Disconnect the motor power cables.

		To install the arms, first route the motor power cable to the proper side of the arm so that the cables do not get pinched between the arm and the plastic keeper.  Next, insert the arm into the body of the aircraft, and line up the screw holes.  The screw on the top of the body is hidden underneath the autopilot.  Simply push the autopilot gently out of the way to access the screw hole.  Install the screws.  Push the arm towards the plastic keeper until the keeper engages.  Connect the motor power wires.  Conduct the Spin Up Check to ensure that the motor is wired correctly.  If the motor spins backwards, flip any two motor power wires.  Conduct the Propeller Alignment Procedure to properly align the propellers.
	\section{Replacing the Payload Antenna}
		To replace the payload antenna, first disconnect the payload antenna from the payload by unscrewing the SMA connector on the antenna.  Next, uninstall the antenna by removing the zip ties holding the antenna to the copter.

		To install the payload antenna, first check that the insulating tape on the copter booms is intact.  Next, attach the antenna to the copter using zip ties.  Ensure that the antenna is only contacting the insulating tape, and not the carbon fiber booms.  Next, connect the SMA connectors on the antenna and the payload.
	\section{Replacing the Payload}
		To remove the payload, first disconnect the payload power, autopilot telemetry cable, and payload antenna from the payload.  Next, remove the two screws holding the payload to the aircraft.

		To install the payload, align the payload with the existing screw holes on the aircraft so that the user interface devices face the outside of the aircraft.  Install the two screws to secure the payload to the aircraft.  Connect the payload power, autopilot telemetry cable, and payload antenna to the payload.
	\section{Charging Batteries}
		When charging batteries, it is important to ensure that the batteries assigned to a flight pack are charged and discharged together.  This ensures that all the cells are balanced and taking the same amount of wear and tear, reducing the risk of a single cell being depleted and destroying the rest of the cells.

		The first time the batteries are charged, charge all of the batteries individually, then split them into their flight packs.

		For the remaining time that batteries are charged, charge all batteries in their flight packs.

		To charge a single battery, connect the battery's main plug into the charging adapter and insert the battery's balance plug into the charger.  Configure the charger for a maximum current of 5.3 amps, 3 cell LiPo, and a maximum charge of 5500 mAh.

		To charge a complete pack (3 matched batteries), connect each battery's main plug into to the charging adapter and each battery's balance plug into the parallel adapter.  Configure the charger for a maximum current of 16 amps, 3 cell LiPo, and a maximum charge of 16000 mAh.

		To initiate the charging process, press and hold the ``Start'' button until the charger beeps and initiates the ``Battery Check'' sequence.  The charger will then begin the charging process.

		To end the charging process, press the ``Stop'' button.  Verify that the charger has stopped charging, and disconnect the battery's main plug and balance plug.

	\section{Operating a Mission}
		The primary responsiblity of the \gls{AO} is to monitor the \gls{uas} as it progresses through its programmed mission.  During this time, the autopilot operator should be monitoring the vital signs from the \gls{uas}, including ground speed, mission progress, altitude, attitude, stability, battery voltage, battery consumption, power draw, and navigation stability, among other things.  In most cases, monitoring the artificial horizon and flight map will suffice - check that the \gls{uas} is tracking properly to the waypoints, and that the airctaft has a reasonable attitude for its current speed and heading.  Occasionally, check the battery voltage and consumption to ensure that the \gls{uas} has enough power to complete the mission and return.
